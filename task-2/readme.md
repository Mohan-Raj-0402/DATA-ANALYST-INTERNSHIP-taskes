This project presents a detailed Power BI dashboard that analyzes the **Sample Superstore** dataset. The goal is to uncover insights into sales performance, customer behavior, product trends, and regional performance to support data-driven decision-making.

## Storytelling Overview

This dashboard tells the story of a growing retail company that operates across the United States. The leadership team wants to understand how to **increase profits**, **optimize operations**, and **expand into new markets**. Using historical data, the analysis explores:

- Where the company is making money — and where it is losing it.
- Which customer segments are most valuable.
- Which products are performing best — and which are dragging down profits.
- How regions and states compare in terms of sales and profitability.

The dashboard walks the user through key business questions and gives actionable insights using interactive visuals.

## Key Insights from the Dashboard

### 1. **Sales and Profit Overview**
- **Total Sales** and **Total Profit** are displayed with key KPIs.
- A monthly trend line shows seasonal changes and sales cycles.
- The company sees strong sales, but profit margins vary significantly.

### 2. **Top Products and Categories**
- The dashboard highlights **high-performing products** in terms of sales.
- It also flags **low-profit or negative-profit items**, guiding product strategy.

### 3. **Customer Segmentation**
- Customers are segmented by **Region**, **Segment (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office)**, and **Shipping Mode**.
- Corporate customers contribute the most revenue but aren't always the most profitable.

### 4. **Geographic Performance**
- A US map shows state-level performance.
- Certain states like **California** and **New York** perform strongly in both sales and profit.
- Others, like **Texas** and **Illinois**, show high sales but lower or negative profits — indicating inefficiencies.

### 5. **Profitability Analysis**
- Using a scatter plot or heatmap, we compare **Sales vs. Profit** by product and region.
- This reveals hidden losses in categories like **Technology** in some regions, while **Office Supplies** remain consistent performers.
