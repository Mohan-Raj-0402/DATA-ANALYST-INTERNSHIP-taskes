## Titanic Survival Prediction - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns that affect passenger survival using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques in Python.

### 📁 Files

- `titanic_EDA.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis and visualizations.

### 📊 Objective

The goal is to analyze the Titanic dataset to:
- Understand the distribution of survival vs non-survival.
- Identify important features affecting survival (e.g., age, gender, class).
- Visualize relationships using plots and charts.

### 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

### 📈 Key Insights

- Females had a higher survival rate than males.
- Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive.
- Younger passengers had better survival chances.
- Families traveling together had varying survival rates.
